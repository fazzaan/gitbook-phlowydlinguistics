# Respelling of Vowels

Some vocabulary first

* A standard letter creates one sound at a time.
* A digraph is two letters that create one sound together, or create a diphthong that doesn't match the letters' base values.
* We define a monograph as one letter that creates two sounds at the same time — usually a díφþoŋ (diphthong).
* A díφþoŋ is two vowel sounds pronounced edge-to-edge.
* A mónoφþoŋ is one vowel sound pronounced independently.

## Monophthong Vowels

### Monograph alterations

W modifies vowels in standard Eŋglish. This is messy and seemingly unnecessary in modern Eŋglish so we are removing it.

W is included in the _Monographs_ section because the W itself still produces the /w/ phoneme, but it modifies the proceeding vowel, which is a monograph.

* wa- and wha- as /wɔ/ (water, what) change to
* wo- and who- — because the letter ⟨a⟩ never makes the /ɔ/-vowels unless preceded by a ⟨w⟩.

### Digraphs to monophthongs

There are not many digraph monophthong vowels in English. Most digraphs

* ⟨ae⟩ as /ɪː\~eː/ changes to æ
* ⟨oe⟩ as /ɪj\~yː/ changes to œ — protects pronunciation.

## Diphthong Vowels

### Monograph compressions — Magic E

Monographs are (in this publication, at least) singular letters which carry a diphthong value — two vowel sounds together.

Magic E diphthongs are considered as monographs because, when the final E is removed to make way for a suffix, the Magic E vowel maintains its diphthong value.

* a as /ɛj/ in "face". The /ɛj/ is retained with the suffix -ing, _facing_.

### Monographs alterations — no Magic E

Some vowels have diphthong values despite there being no Magic E.

* i in "kind" → ī = kīnd
* o in "go" → ō = gō

### Digraph modifications

This can involve:

* changing the letters
* marking the letters
* changing and marking the letters.

**Examples**

* ⟨ow⟩ as /aw/ changes to:
  * ⟨aw⟩ at the end of a word
  * ⟨aw⟩ if a vowel follows it (maybe?)
  * ⟨aŭ⟩ if a consonant follows it.
* ⟨ow⟩ as /əw/ changes to:
  * /ōw/ at the end of a word
  * ⟨ōw⟩ if a vowel follows it (maybe?)
  * ⟨ōŭ⟩ if a consonant follows it. (maybe?) (shown → ʃōŭn)

## R-tail Vowels - rules retained

The Vowel+R rules are retained in NewEng.

### Vowel+R

* -ar →
* -er → -r -- if the E is unpronounced or is unstressed /ɜː/\~/ə/
* -ir →
* -or →
* -oor → ꝏr
* -our → ȣr
* -ur →

{% hint style="info" %}
See section/page about -or and -er suffix reduction.
{% endhint %}

If a vowel is followed by R or RR but its sound is its base value, mark it with the inverted chevron, as such: _ǎ ě ǐ ǒ ǔ_.\
(This diacritic choice is under review, because it looks too similar to the breve diacritic: ŏ / ǒ.

* ar : carry → cǎry
* er : ferry → fěry
* ir : mirror → mǐror
* or : borrow → bǒ́rōw
* burrow : bǔ́rōw

If the vowel's pronunciation is of another value, mark it accordingly:

* our : courage → cȣ̂rȧj

### Vowel+R+E

* -are → ăr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "mare", "square", "spare", "bare"
* -ere → ĕr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "there", "where"
* -ire → īr for /ɑjə(ɹ)/ in "fire," "dire", "mire", "wire"
* -ore → or for /ɔ:(ɹ)/ in "more", "core", "lore"
* -ure → ŭr or ūr

## W-tail Vowels - rules removed

The _Vowel+W_ rules from Current English are NOT retained in NewEng.

Vowels retain their base value, plus the /w/ closing position.

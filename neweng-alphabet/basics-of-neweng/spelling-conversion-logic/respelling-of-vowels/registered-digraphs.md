# Registered Diphthongs

In NewEng, all pure digraphs are vowels.

_Assimilative digraphs in consonant space remain, because these are mostly (if not entirely) a physical phenomenon arising from the movement of the mouth._

## English Diphthongs

Diphthongs of English are:

* /ɪj/ "me"
* /ɛj/ "may"
* /ɑj/ "my"
* /oj/ "boy"
* /aw/ "cow"
* /əw/ "go"
* /ɔw/ "cold[^1]"&#x20;
* /uw/ "zoo"

## Reducing unnecessary complexity

In the vowel respelling phase, several common digraphs are replaced with more accurate digraphs.

However, some of them have unnecessary complexity.

### AŬ → AU for /_aʊ_/\~/_aw_/

**Instead of writing ⟨aŭ⟩ to represent /**_**aʊ**_**/, NewEng uses ⟨au⟩.**

⟨ou⟩ has long been used to represent the /_aʊ_/ diφþoŋ, as in "cow": _round, count, house_.

This is, frankly, a ridiculous dīgraφ for suч a diφþoŋ.

The ⟨ou⟩ dīgraφ is broadly replaced by the ligature vowel ȣ, taken directly from ancient Greek and Latin usage, but its sound is not for the /_aʊ_/ diφþoŋ.

To meet the phonetic standard of NewEng, /_aʊ_/ is represented by ⟨aŭ⟩.

However, the breve diacritic on the u, ⟨ŭ⟩, is also unnecessary, because /_aʌ_/ does not exist in English phonology. Therefore, ⟨aŭ⟩ can be written more simply and quickly as ⟨au⟩. This saves time in handwriting, and saves characters in typing.

### /ɔw/ "cold"

_Jury is very much STILL OUT on this one, with regards to how exactly to transcribe this in NewEng._\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;ll instances of /ɔw/ appear to be pre-Dark-L, thus it is a phenomenological result of position assimilation, rather than a real phoneme._\
&#xNAN;_&#x48;owever, should it be rendered as /əw/ or /ɔw/? Writing it as ⟨ō⟩, which represents /ə/, is arguably wrong._\
&#xNAN;_&#x49; have no idea what to do with homophones like roll and role._

There is no Single Vowel diphthong for /oj/ "boy" or /aw/ "cow".

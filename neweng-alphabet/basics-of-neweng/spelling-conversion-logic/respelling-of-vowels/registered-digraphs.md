# Registered Digraphs

In NewEng, all pure digraphs are vowels.

Assimilative digraphs in consonant space remain, because these are mostly (if not entirely) a physical phenomenon arising from the movement of the mouth.

## Reducing unnecessary complexity

In the vowel respelling phase, several common digraphs are replaced with more accurate digraphs.

However, some of them have unnecessary complexity.

### AŬ → AU for /_aʊ_/\~/_aw_/

**Instead of writing ⟨aŭ⟩ to represent /**_**aʊ**_**/, NewEng uses ⟨au⟩.**

⟨ou⟩ has long been used to represent the /_aʊ_/ diφþoŋ, as in "cow": _round, count, house_.&#x20;

This is, frankly, a ridiculous dīgraφ for suч a diφþoŋ.

The ⟨ou⟩ dīgraφ is broadly replaced by the ligature vowel ȣ, taken directly from ancient Greek and Latin usage, but its sound is not for the /_aʊ_/ diφþoŋ.

To meet the phonetic standard of NewEng, /_aʊ_/ is represented by ⟨aŭ⟩.

However, the breve diacritic on the u, ⟨ŭ⟩, is also unnecessary, because /_aʌ_/ does not exist in English phonology. Therefore, ⟨aŭ⟩ can be written more simply and quickly as ⟨au⟩. This saves time in handwriting, and saves characters in typing.

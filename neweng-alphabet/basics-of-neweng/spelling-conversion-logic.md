# Spelling conversion logic

## Primary Goals but written concisely

1. Simplify spellings.
   1. One letter has one sound, but one sound can be made by several letters. No digraphs.
   2. Diacritics are allowed for preserving spelling patterns; respelling is preferred.
   3. Phonetic consonant respelling (where reasonable).&#x20;
   4. No double letters (unless necessary).
   5. Phonetic vowel respelling (if diacritics are too messy).
   6. No vowels split apart.
2. Increase visual consistency & distinction.
   1. Preserve etymological spelling patterns.
   2. Retain visual distinctions between homophones.
   3. Increase visual distinction between homographs & homonyms.
   4. Increase the ability for non-natives to decode English based on apparent patterns and logic.


## Primary Goals 

### 1. Simplify spellings.  

1. One letter has one sound (phoneme).     E.g.:

* t is always /t/
* þ is always /θ/

2. One sound can be made by many letters.     E.g.:

* /ʃ/ can be made by ʃ, š, ťiV, ʞ̌, ч̌, ç̌
* /k/ can be made by c, k, q, ʞ
* /ʤ/ can be made by j, ǧ, ď

3. Modifications are allowed using diacritics.

4. Multiple letters are allowed to produce the same phonemic values.

5. No double letters, unless necessary.

6. No vowel combinations split apart (like ⟨a⟩ in ⟨face⟩).

7. Phonetic respelling for standard pronunciation mutations.

* Voiced ⟨s⟩ suffix after voiced codas, compare ducks /dʌks/ & dogs /dɔɡz/.

* g as j /ʤ/ in ⟨ge/gi/gy⟩

8. Phonetic respelling for unreasonable or unresolvable vowel variations.

* ⟨ou⟩ is remarkably common and also remarkably nonsensical.&#x20;



### 2. Retain & maximize visual & aural distinctions.
1. Preserve etymological spelling patterns.
2. Retain visual distinctions between homophones.
  1. Not all homophones are homophones in every accent. Erasing distinctions is deleterious and culturally insensitive (see Gaal Dornick in _Foundation_). Grammatic homophones tend to exist in most accents, whereas semantic homophones tend to have arisen as a result of [phonological mergers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Splits_and_mergers_in_English_phonology).
	 1. Semantic: bow vs bough → baw vs báŭȝ 
	 2. Grammatic: passed vs past  → pâsèd (or pâsd) vs pâst 
	 3. Rhotic: raw vs roar → råw vs ro̊r 
	 4. Mergers/splitters: too many examples to put here, see the dedicated section/page. 
3. Increase visual distinction between homographs and homonyms.
  1. Bow — /baw/ vs /bəw/ → baw vs bōw
  2. Row — /ɹaw/ vs /ɹəw/ → raw vs rōw 
  3.



## Simplifications 

The primary goals:
* reduce letter count 
* reduce spelling & letter-sound exceptions 
* reduce vowel complexity 

### Double letter simplifications

* Almost all double letters in English spelling serve for pronunciation effects, such as retaining checked vowels, and implying position of syllable stress. This is no longer necessary with NewEng, which marks vowel quality and syllable stress. 
* ck → k 
	* The ck functions the same as a doubled consonant. 
	* The k is also to prevent e/i/y from changing the c into a /s/. 
	* Keep the k only. 

### Consonant digraphs 

We replace all digraphs with single letters. This is the reason for adding new letters to the alphabet.

* ch → ч -- English digraph as /ʧ/
* ch → ч̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* ch → ʞ -- Greek-root digraph as /k\~x/
* ch → ʞ̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/ from Greek as /k/&#x20;
* gh → ȝ -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/
* gh → ȝ̌ -- digraph as /f\~ɸ/
* gh → ȝ̊ -- digraph as /ɡ/ (actually I think this never exists) 
* gn → ȝn -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/+/n/
* gn → ȝ̊n -- non-digraph as /ɡn/ showing relation to /ɣn/
* ny → и -- Spanish-root digraph as /ɲ/
* ñ → и -- Spanish monograph as /ɲ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋ -- English digraph as /ŋ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋg -- English digraph as /ŋɡ/ (deficient)&#x20;
* ng → nǧ -- English digraph as /nʤ/ (deficient) \[consider ⟨nj⟩]
* ph → φ -- Greek-root digraph as /f/
* sh → ʃ -- English digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* th → þ -- English digraph as /θ/&#x20;
* th → ð -- English digraph as /ð/&#x20;
* wh → ƕ -- English digraph as /w\~ʍ/

### Vowel digraphs (simple ones)

* ae → æ
* oe → œ
* oo → ꝏ&#x20;
* ou → ȣ -- (not as /aw/)


## Suffixes 

### -ER suffix
Verbs - keep ER  
Nouns - reduce ER to R if unstressed  
Adjectives - unsure. Maybe keep ER for superlatives, or change to RE as per MORE. (Although MORE is now spelled MOR so doesn't make sense.)

### -OR suffix
* Usually for agentive nouns.  
Nouns - keep OR  

### -ED suffix
* Keep -d and -ed for all past participles and adjectives.  

### -ESS suffixes 

* -ness -- retain double s, -ness marks a noun -- different from -n+es
* -less -- retain double s, -less marks some adjectives -- different from -l+es

### -S and -SS

See _Grammatical suffixes._   


## Grammatical suffixes 

In English, there are an array of grammatical word mutations which result in ambiguity. With grammatical context, situational context and intonation, there is _rarely_ any ambiguity in either the spoken or the written language. But spelling is a tool to decrease ambiguity too, so in a respelling process such as this, we make it our intention to further decrease ambiguity where possible, and certainly avoid introducing additional ambiguity.  

English has many homophones already, some of which exist due to grammatical mutations. Some are seemingly unavoidable because there are no rules as to what is allowed in the phonetic structure of a word.  

* Past participle of a verb is formed by adding a D suffix.  
  * Depending on base word pronunciation, this D may be realised as a /d/, a /t/ or an /ɪd/.  
  * However, many verbs in base form already end in /t/, /d/ and /ɪd/.  
  * We can resolve this in written text by appending a silenced E to the end of verbs with the /d/ or /t/ coda. An E is chosen because, when the past participle is formed by adding a /d/, the E will be pronounced as an /ɪ/ (or rarely an /e~ɛ/). Additionally, the letter E is already well-known as a commonly-silent letter, so this will be much easier for people to learn & understand than would be appendance of a silenced I.
  * The silenced E appears as such: 
    * è ← e + altgr+/  OR  e + altgr+P  
	* crowd → cráŭdè → cráŭdėd  
	* raid → răidè → răidėd  
	* weld → weldè → wéldėd  
	* brand → brandè → brándėd  
	* void → voidè → vóidėd  
	* fold → foldè → fóldėd  

* Third person inflection of a verb is formed by adding a S suffix.  
  * Depending on base word pronunciation, this S may be realised as a /s/, a /z/ or an /ɪz/.  
  * However, several verbs in base form already end in a /s/, /z/ and /ɪz/.  
  * We can resolve this in written text by appending a silenced E to the end of verbs with the /s/ or /z/ coda. Actually, this is already the case with a lot of verbs in the current standard English orthography. An E is chosen for the same reason as with the D coda -- when the 3rd person inflection is formed by adding a S, the E will be pronounced as an /ɪ/.
  * Additionally, some verbs end in /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ʧ/ and /ʤ/. Appending an S on the end phonetically requires an interstitial /ɪ/.
  * The silenced E appears as such: 
    * è ← e + altgr+/  OR  e + altgr+P  
	* Single S /s/ series 
	  * s → sè → sėz 
	  * focus → fōcŭsè → fōcŭsėz 
	  * Seems to be very rare. Some exist but tend to be derived from a repurposed noun. 
	* Double S /s/ series 
	  * ss → sè → sėz 
	  * confess → confésè → confésėz
	  * fuss → fusè → fúsėz 
	  * pass → pâsè → pâsėz 
	  * cross → crosè → crósėz 
	  * hiss → hisè → hísėz 
	  * press → presè → présėz 
	* CE /s/ series 
	  * ce → çè → çėz 
	  * race → rāçè → rāçėz 
	  * face → fāçè → fāçėz 
	  * reduce → rėďūçè → rėďūçėz 
	  * place → plāçè → plāçėz 
	* SE /s/ series 
	  * se → sè → sėz 
	  * base → bāsè → bāsėz 
	  * collapse → colápsè → colápsėz 
	  * convulse → convúlsè → convúlsėz 
	  * disperse → dispérsè → dispérsėz 
	  * decease → dėçēsè → dėçēsėz 
	  * grease → grēsè → grēsėz 
	  * lease → lēsè → lēsėz 
	* SE /z/ series 
	  * se → zè → zėz 
	  * choose → чꝏzè → чꝏzėz 
	  * cause → cåzè → cåzėz 
	  * muse → mūzè → mūzėz 
	  * rise → rīzè → rīzėz 
	  * confuse → confūzè → confūzėz 
	  * bruise → brūzè → brūzėz 
	  * analyse → ánalȳzè → ánalȳzėz 
	  * prise → prīs̈è → prīs̈ėz (cannot be prīzè because of prize) 
	    * se → s̈è → s̈ėz  (special cases) 
	* ZE /z/ series 
	  * ze → zè → zėz 
	  * raze 
	  * prize 
	  * amaze 
	* SH /ʃ/ series

### Final S & Z and Final D 

I have no recollection ov what I was planning to write here. Perhaps it's already been written in the previous чunk. 


## Respelling of Vowels 

Some vocabulary first 

* A standard letter creates one sound at a time. 
* A digraph is two letters that create one sound together, or create a diphthong that doesn't match the letters' base values.  
* We define a monograph as one letter that creates two sounds at the same time — usually a díφþoŋ (diphthong). 
* A díφþoŋ is two vowel sounds pronounced edge-to-edge. 
* A mónoφþoŋ is one vowel sound pronounced independently. 

### Monophthong Vowels 

#### Monograph alterations 

W modifies vowels in standard Eŋglish. This is messy and seemingly unnecessary in modern Eŋglish so we are removing it.  

W is included in the _Monographs_ section because the W itself still produces the /w/ phoneme, but it modifies the proceeding vowel, which is a monograph.  

* wa- and wha- as /wɔ/ (water, what) change to 
* wo- and who- — because the letter ⟨a⟩ never makes the /ɔ/-vowels unless preceded by a ⟨w⟩. 

#### Digraphs to monophthongs 

There are not many digraph monophthong vowels in English. Most digraphs

* ⟨ae⟩ as /ɪː\~eː/ changes to æ&#x20;
* ⟨oe⟩ as /ɪj\~yː/ changes to œ — protects pronunciation. 



### Diphthong Vowels

#### Monograph compressions — Magic E

Monographs are (in this publication, at least) singular letters which carry a diphthong value — two vowel sounds together.  

Magic E diphthongs are considered as monographs because, when the final E is removed to make way for a suffix, the Magic E vowel maintains its diphthong value.

* a as /ɛj/ in "face". The /ɛj/ is retained with the suffix -ing, _facing_. 

#### Monographs alterations — no Magic E

Some vowels have diphthong values despite there being no Magic E. 

* i in "kind" → ī = kīnd&#x20;
* o in "go" → ō = gō&#x20;

#### Digraph modifications 

This can involve:
* changing the letters
* marking the letters 
* changing and marking the letters. 

##### Examples 

* ⟨ow⟩ as /aw/ changes to: 
  * ⟨aw⟩ at the end of a word 
  * ⟨aw⟩ if a vowel follows it (maybe?)
  * ⟨aŭ⟩ if a consonant follows it.
* ⟨ow⟩ as /əw/ changes to: 
  * /ōw/ at the end of a word 
  * ⟨ōw⟩ if a vowel follows it (maybe?)
  * ⟨ōŭ⟩ if a consonant follows it. (maybe?) (shown → ʃōŭn)


### R-tail Vowels - rules retained

The Vowel+R rules are retained in NewEng.

#### Vowel+R

* -ar → 
* -er → -r -- if the E is unpronounced or is unstressed /ɜː/\~/ə/&#x20;
* -ir → 
* -or → 
* -oor → ꝏr 
* -our → ȣr 
* -ur →  

Info/Tip: See section/page about -or and -er suffix reduction.

If a vowel is followed by R or RR but its phone is its base value, mark it with the inverted chevron, as such: ǒ.  
(This diacritic choice is under review, because it looks too similar to the breve diacritic: ŏ / ǒ. 

* ar : carry → cǎry
* er : ferry → fěry 
* ir : mirror → mǐror
* or : borrow → bǒrōw 
* bury
  
If the vowel's pronunciation is of another value, mark it accordingly:  

* our : courage → cȣ̂rȧj 


#### Vowel+R+E

* -are → ăr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "mare", "square", "spare", "bare"&#x20;
* -ere → ĕr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "there", "where"
* -ire → īr for /ɑjə(ɹ)/ in "fire," "dire", "mire", "wire"
* -ore → or for /ɔ:(ɹ)/ in "more", "core", "lore"
* -ure → ŭr or ūr 



### W-tail Vowels - rules removed

The _Vowel+W_ rules from Current English are NOT retained in NewEng.&#x20;

Vowels retain their base value, plus the /w/ closing position.&#x20;

| New                      | Old                          | New fix for Old                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ⟨aw⟩ is /aw/             | ⟨aw⟩ was /ɔː/                | ⟨aw⟩ as /ɔː/ is ⟨åw⟩                                |
| ⟨ēw⟩ is /ɪjuw/          | ⟨ew⟩ was /ɪjuw/              | ⟨ew⟩ is invalid                                      |
| ⟨ow⟩ is /ɔw/ like "cold" | ⟨ow⟩ was /ɔw/ & /əw/ & /aw/  | <p>⟨ow⟩ as /aw/ is ⟨aw⟩<br>⟨ow⟩ as /əw/ is ⟨ōw⟩</p> |
| ⟨ōw⟩ is /əw/ like "tow" | ⟨ow⟩ was /ɔw/ & /əw/ & /aw/  | <p>⟨ow⟩ as /aw/ is ⟨aw⟩<br>⟨ow⟩ as /ow/ is ⟨ow⟩</p>  |

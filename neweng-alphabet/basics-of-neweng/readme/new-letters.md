Rarely present in English: primarily assimilative (as in ⟨ny⟩ in “canyon”) or imported (as in ⟨ñ⟩ in “señor”). </li><li>Native English speakers with no awareness of palatal phones tend towards pronouncing both ⟨ny⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ as [nj]; non-native speakers tend towards pronouncing both as [ɲ] because this phoneme exists in a broad array of languages. </li><li>⟨ny⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ are not phonemically-contrasting in English and there is no trend towards it, thus a single letter is suitable: ⟨Ии⟩ (or ⟨Թթ⟩).</li><li>Letter is based on the Nn shapes and the shape of the first choice was derived from the Armenian letter T’o /tʰ/. This glyph does not fit Latinate glyphset styles so it is likely that the Cyrillic И will be used instead. The only problem with this is its identicality with N, rendering issues for dyslexic readers and new learners: most letters in English are distinct from one another (with the wild exception of dbqp). </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ŋ</td><td>ŋ</td><td>inga</td><td>iŋa</td><td>/ˈɪŋ.a/</td><td><ul><li>⟨ng⟩ is a ridiculous and long-standing digraph in English which actually hosts a tonne of ambiguous spellings, but for some reason has never been replaced: /ŋ/, /ŋɡ/, /nʤ/ are all very common. </li><li>⟨nk⟩ is also very common, mainly producing /ŋk/. </li><li>⟨nx⟩ exists rarely, e.g. anxious /ŋʃ ~ ŋk̚ʃ/ and anxiety /ŋz/.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Œ</td><td>œ</td><td>oecō</td><td>œ́cō</td><td>/ˈy.kəw/</td><td><ul><li>Lock in pre-shift vowels e.g. economic is /ij/ (/y/) not /e/.

Ironically, not a single represented diphthong reflects the phonetic values of o+u. </li><li>The ȣ ligature has been selected to visually represent the modern digraph in a single character, and can be diacritiqued to modify its phonetic value. Where the ⟨ou⟩ digraph’s phonetic value can be better represented with other letters, it is. (E.g. house → haŭs.)</li><li>This glyph in many fonts is unwieldy and overheight; I have modified its appearance in a few standard fonts to be the same height as other vowels.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ʃ</td><td>ʃ</td><td>esh</td><td>eʃ</td><td>/ɛʃ/</td><td><ul><li>Represents ⟨sh⟩ as /ʃ/.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ч</td><td>ч</td><td>chee</td><td>чē</td><td>/ʧij/</td><td><ul><li>Represents ⟨ch⟩ as /ʧ/. Phonetic counterpart to the voiced ⟨j⟩ /ʤ/.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ƕ</td><td>ƕ</td><td>hwair</td><td>hwăr</td><td>/ʍɛːɹ/</td><td><ul><li>Aspirated w, i.e. ⟨wh⟩ in current orthography.

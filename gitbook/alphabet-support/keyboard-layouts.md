## Physical keyboards

The only keyboard layout currently available for NewEng can be downloaded from my GitHub page.

### Physical layout types

<details>

<summary><strong>Use AltGr to access 3rd level</strong> on regular QWERTY layout</summary>

* Works with normal keyboards.&#x20;
* Clunky to use.&#x20;
* Retains number row.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Use <strong>number row</strong> for 11 new letters (including ` key)</summary>

* Works with normal keyboards.
* Displaces number & symbol row:
  * Requires NumPad for easy number input.
  * Use AltGr to access standard symbols.
  * Can use AltGr+Shift for numbers if you don't have a NumPad.
* Easier to use than AltGr version, but takes time to learn the new letters' positions.
* Still requires AltGr for æ, œ, и and some diacritics (on u, i, o, b, m, -, ;, ', ]).
* Can use AltGr to access some diacritiqued letters: ž s̈ g̊ g̃ ǧ ť.
* Hwair ƕ and Echo ʞ are also available on w and k, respectively.
* _F# keys are not used much these days so could feasibly be used as the number row instead._

<summary>Ph<strong>ysical keyboard with another row</strong></summary>

* Requires a new physical keyboard device to be manufactured.
* Visually clear, no need to memorize where each letter is hiding.
* Minor skill adaptation required, number+symbol row has moved upwards.
* Can bear layout parity with a virtual touchscreen keyboard.

## Virtual keyboards (touchscreen)

1. Keyboard Designer — [website](https://www.keyboarddesigner.com/)&#x20;
   1. Free to design your own keyboard layouts
   2. Paid version required to be able to import other creators' designs. ([Low cost - view details](https://www.keyboarddesigner.com/index.php?page=32))
   3. Download my keyboard design from my GitHub (out of date; don't use yet!)

I haven't yet found another keyboard app that allows me to design my own layout.

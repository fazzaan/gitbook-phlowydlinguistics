# Phase 1: Letters & Stress

* add stress diacritic
* retaining spelling system
* changing digraphs for new monographs



Phase 1 combines Steps 1 & 2: Mark stress, and Letter conversion.&#x20;

Phase 1 transition should be easily readable by anyone who spends a few hours familiarising themselves with the substitutions. The new letters are easily writable by just paying attention to the pronunciation of the current digraphs and mentally double-checking for the pronunciation patterns of any obviously-related words.

## Step 1: <mark style="color:red;">Mark stress</mark>

Marking stress is simple and easy, as this is a feature in a lot of languages: á.

In handwriting, this is extremely simple. The angle must be enforced because a future phase (Layer 5) will introduce 3 other diacritic marks which have the potential to look similar: á à ā ȧ.

In typing, a key can be repurposed for the stress diacritic, or&#x20;

Stress only needs to be marked on words with multiple syllables.&#x20;

Layer 5 introduces diacritics for vowels. If a vowel has a diacritic, it is assumed to take stress. If that vowel is the stressed syllable, no stress diacritic is required. If the stressed syllable is elsewhere, the correct vowel requires a stress diacritic.

### Examples



## Step 2: <mark style="color:red;">Letter conversion</mark>

In the letter conversion transition layer, all standard digraphs are replaced with monographs, primarily new letters.&#x20;

### **Limitations**

To ease transition within the current generation of people and technology, all new letters must exist within Unicode and have an upper and a lower case glyph available. Preferably the cases are linked in their Unicode definitions, but sometimes that is not possible (Ʞ and ʞ are appear to not be connected correctly in the Unicode definition, and most apps also have not made the connection).

### Letters

The current English digraphs are:&#x20;

H-series: ch gh ph sh th th wh

Other: ck

_Qu is not a digraph. The q represents a /k/ (a pharyngeal allophone) before a /w/, a non-syllabic allophone of u._&#x20;

Vowels: ae a\_e ai au aw ay / ea ee e\_e ei ew ey / ie i\_e / oa oe o\_e oi oo ou ow oy / ue u\_e ui uy

Consonant digraphs can be replaced easily; vowel digraphs are dramatically messier.

#### Consonants

* ch → ч   —   /ʧ/ in English and /ʃ/ in French words
* ch → ʞ   —   /k/ in Greek words and /ʃ/ in Greek words via French
* gh → ȝ   —   /ɣ\~ɸ\~f\~(x)/ and silence (modern phonology)
* ph → φ  —   /f/ in Greek words
* sh → ʃ    —   /ʃ/ in English words
* th → þ   —   /θ/ in English and Greek words
* th → ð   —   /ð/ in English and Greek words
* wh → ƕ —   /ʰw\~ʍ/ in English words (probably P/Q Celt division)

#### Vowels

The only vowels being replaced at this stage are the four true digraphs:

* ae → æ   —   /e/ in Latin & Greek words, maybe also Old English
* oe → œ   —   /y/ in Latin & Greek words
* oo → ꝏ  —   /uw/ and /ɵ\~ʊ/ in English words
* ou → ȣ    —   /uw/ and /ɵ\~ʊ/ in English etc words

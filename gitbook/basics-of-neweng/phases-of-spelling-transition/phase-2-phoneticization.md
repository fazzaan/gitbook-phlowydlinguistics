# Phase 2: Phonetiçīzā́tion

* Step 3: <mark style="color:yellow;">Mark consonants with diacritics</mark>.&#x20;
  * This may take 5-8 years or even 1-2 generations.&#x20;
* Step 4: <mark style="color:yellow;">Replace consonants with more-phonetically accurate consonants</mark>.&#x20;
  * Common assimilations, such as dr → jr and tr → чr.
  * Consonants that are commonly marked diacritically with phonetic counterparts.
  * It can be taught that these exist as pairs and equivalents, e.g. s → s̈ → z
  * Certain consonants simply have to suffer the situation, such as that the suffix -ed cannot be replaced with t because doing so causes conflation with nouns from verbs ending in -t.&#x20;
    * passed / past
    * missed / mist
    * massed / mast
    * Thus, need to retain the spellings of (most[^1]) grammatical particles.

## Common assimilations

_but these have to be checked in case of erasing systematic homophone distinctions_

#### Ū as /juw/ series

due → ďū → jū

tune → ťūn → чūn

#### R as /ɹ/ series



drive → ďrīv → jrīv

drink → ďriŋk → jriŋk

truth → ťrūþ → чrūþ .......... \[ note that -ue really _is_ /juw/ and _true_ was pronounced archaically as /tɹjuː/ ]

trick → ťrik → чrik

_There are no chr as /ʧɹ/ spellings! Does this suggest that the tr spelling was chosen to represent this phonetic sequence **over** chr? Leaving ⟨chr⟩ for /kʰɹ/ from Greek? So how was /ʧɹ/ in ⟨tr⟩ words spelled historically?_

_This aligns with the lack of sr spellings — s-like followed by r only exists as shr._

_For some reason, there is no zr or zhr. (Also no zh in general.)_

_And there is no jr, which I suppose aligns with the lack of chr._









[^1]: -ed; maybe even doubling the final consonant prior to the suffix.

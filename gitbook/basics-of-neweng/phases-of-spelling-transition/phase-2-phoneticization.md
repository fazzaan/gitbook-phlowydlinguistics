# Phase 2: Phonetiçīzā́tion

* Step 3: <mark style="color:yellow;">Mark consonants with diacritics</mark>.&#x20;
  * This may take 5-8 years or even 1-2 generations.&#x20;

  * Common assimilations, such as dr → jr and tr → чr.
  * Consonants that are commonly marked diacritically with phonetic counterparts.
  * It can be taught that these exist as pairs and equivalents, e.g. s → s̈ → z
  * Certain consonants simply have to suffer the situation, such as that the suffix -ed cannot be replaced with t because doing so causes conflation with nouns from verbs ending in -t.&#x20;
    * passed / past
    * missed / mist
    * massed / mast
    * Thus, need to retain the spellings of (most[^1]) grammatical particles.

## Common assimilations — U, R, I

_but these have to be checked in case of erasing systematic homophone distinctions_

### Ū as /juw/ series

Here are some examples of assimilation between alveolar ridge sounds d, t, s & z, and the palatal onset /j/ of the u vowel ⟨u⟩.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="289">du → ďū → jū</th><th width="181">tu → ťū → чū</th><th width="207">su → šŭ → ʃŭ</th><th>s̈u → zu → žŭ / g̃ŭ</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>dune → ďūn → jūn (dura)</td><td>tune → чūn</td><td>sugar → šŭg̊ar → ʃŭg̊ar</td><td>usual → ū́žŭal</td></tr><tr><td>duly → ďūly → jŭlȳ́</td><td>venture → vénчŭr</td><td>sure → šŭr → ʃŭr</td><td>measure → méàžŭr</td></tr><tr><td>endure → enďŭr → enjŭr (dura)</td><td>Tuesday → Ťū́zdāy</td><td>assume → ašūm</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table>

* The letter ⟨j⟩ shows that the /ʤ/ descended from palatalization of i /i/.
* Changing ⟨d⟩ to ⟨ď⟩ shows that this form of /ʤ/ arose only from assimilation; it is a phonetic mutation, but not phonemic.
* A quick etymological foray shows that dr and tr in some common words have always been spelled as dr and tr, and that they used to be /dr & tr/ instead of /dɹ & tɹ/. (/ɹ/ may be relatively recent.)&#x20;
* d has parity with t and s. (z does not get a turn.)
* _dune_ as _jūn_ looks identical to _June_ as _Jūn_. (This would not be an isolated case.)
* _dune_ is from the same root as _durable_ and _endure_. Thus, the spellings should have visual similarity. Changing them to _jŭrabl_ and _enjŭr_, but keeping _dune_ with a _d_, would break the visual & orthographic relationship. This demonstrates the power of etymologically-aware spelling systems.&#x20;

### R as /ɹ/ series

There is no specific benefit to changing dr to jr and tr to чr.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>dr → ďr → jr</th><th>tr → ťr → чr</th><th>shr → ʃr</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>drive → ďrīv → jrīv</td><td><a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-2">truth</a> → ťrūþ → чrūþ</td><td>shrine → ʃrīn</td></tr><tr><td>drink → ďriŋk → jriŋk</td><td>trick → ťrik → чrik</td><td>shrink → ʃriŋk</td></tr><tr><td>drain → ďrāin → jrāin</td><td>train → ťrāin → чrāin</td><td>shriek → ʃrïk</td></tr><tr><td>android → ánďroid → ánjroid</td><td>construe → consťrū → consчrū</td><td>mushroom → múʃrꝏm</td></tr><tr><td>laundry → lånďry → lånjry</td><td>country → cȣ̂nťry → cȣ̂nчry</td><td>shrimp → ʃrimp</td></tr><tr><td>mandrake → mánjrāk</td><td>strain → sчrāin</td><td>shrill → ʃril</td></tr><tr><td>dry → ďrȳ → jrȳ (dura)</td><td>try → ťrȳ → чrȳ</td><td>shriek → ʃrïk</td></tr><tr><td>drip → ďrip → jrip</td><td>trip → ťrip → чrip</td><td>shrink → ʃriŋk</td></tr><tr><td>drool → ďrꝏl → jrꝏl</td><td>trowel → чrawel</td><td>shrivel → ʃrivl</td></tr><tr><td>draw → ďråw → jråw</td><td>traipse → чrāips</td><td>shrapnel → ʃrápnel</td></tr><tr><td>drawn → jråwn</td><td>trawl → чråwl</td><td>shrewd → ʃrēwd</td></tr><tr><td>drew → jrēw</td><td>strewn → sчrēwn</td><td>shroud → ʃraŭd</td></tr><tr><td>drawer (box) → jråwr</td><td>straw → sчråw</td><td>shrug → ʃrug</td></tr><tr><td>drawer (person) → jrårer / jråwer</td><td>string → sчriŋ</td><td>shrub → ʃrub</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>strict → sчrict</td><td>shred → ʃred</td></tr></tbody></table>

From the conversion exploration above, it seems that all alveolar–R assimilation letter substitutions are valid and do not cause any ambiguity or other loss.

> _There are no chr as /ʧɹ/ spellings! Does this suggest that the tr spelling was chosen to represent this phonetic sequence **over** chr? Leaving ⟨chr⟩ for /kʰɹ/ from Greek? So how was /ʧɹ/ in ⟨tr⟩ words spelled historically?_&#x20;
>
> _This aligns with the lack of sr spellings — s-like followed by r only exists as shr._
>
> _For some reason, there is no zr or zhr. (Also no zh in general.)_
>
> _And there is no jr, which I suppose aligns with the lack of chr._

* no ⟨jr⟩ or ⟨chr⟩ /ʧɹ/ exist in English spelling currently, so both **jr** and **чr** are available.
* no ⟨sr⟩ exists in English spelling, so there’s no risk of conflation with ⟨shr⟩.
* no /zɹ/ or /ʒɹ/ exist in English spelling.

_However,_

* replacing ⟨dr⟩ with ⟨jr⟩ and ⟨tr⟩ with ⟨чr⟩ does remove the spelling parity with ⟨du⟩, ⟨tu⟩ and ⟨su⟩.

_However,_

* that’s not so different than the lack of ⟨sr⟩ in English, which indicates that shr was already used to phonetically record the permanent and unavoidable (at scale) assimilation shift away from /sɹ/.

So, that’s tidier overall.

### The I series (ioticization)

#### Affricates /ʤ/ & /ʧ/

These are _super_ rare.

| diV /dj→ʤ/        | StiV /Stj→ʧ/                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| soldier → sóljer | question → quésчon or quésťon[^3]  |
|                   | bastion → básťon                    |

* V here represents any vowel
* S represents any sibilant (s, z, ʃ, ʒ)

_See the page on_ [_<mark style="color:red;">**Archiphonemes**</mark>_](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] _to learn more about the symbols V and S._

|                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /djV/ exists in perhaps only 2 or 3 words.                                                                                                                                                           |
| /tjV/ is much more common, but its _de facto_ sound is /ʃ/, as in most _-tion_ suffixes.                                                                                                             |
| /StjV/ is very rare. The /S/, a sibilant, before the assimilated ⟨tiV⟩ as /ʃ/, causes the /ʃ/ to change into a /ʧ/. If it didn't change into a /ʧ/, you would not be able to distinguish the sounds. |

[^1]: -ed; maybe even doubling the final consonant prior to the suffix.

[^2]: note that -ue really _is_ /juw/ and _true_ was pronounced archaically as /tɹjuː/

[^3]: ⟨sť⟩ is valid because /sʧ/ occurs as epenthetic separation due to phonic & locative similarity between /s/ and /ʃ/.



    However, tiV should really change to /ʧ/ in general, by analogy to diV changing to /ʤ/.

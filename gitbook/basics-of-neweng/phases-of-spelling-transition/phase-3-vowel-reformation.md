# Phase 3: Vowel Reformation

This is perhaps the most complex part, because the English vowel system is barely even a system.

Rules we can state about English vowels:

1. Magic E on vowels _or_ Split E.
   1. All of the 6 vowels (yes, including y) are modified by the letter E when the E appears 1, 2 or 3 letters after it, as long as the vowel is not modified by another letter (R, W, L).
      1. o → toe
      2. rot → rote
      3. hang → change
   2. This is extremely prevalent throughout the orthography, and is a defining feature of English.
   3. The rule is also broken in a fair majority of basic vocabulary.
      1. done love dove above
      2. move
      3. have badge&#x20;
      4. wedge
      5. there, where,&#x20;
2. Magic E on consonants
   1. C and G — "Assimilation"
      1. Assimilation is caused by the positions of two phonemes being very close in the mouth, then merging accidentally. This can become entrenched within a language's orthography, which happened in English in the past but modern English allows both assimilated and unassimilated sounds. Thus, ge is /ɡ/ in "get" but /ʤ/ in "general".
      2. Assimilation in English typically occurs between palatal consonants and palatal vowels.
      3. CE CI CY GE GI GY
      4. Mainly applies to C and G, changing C from /k/ into /s/ and G from /ɡ/ into /ʤ/.
      5. The rule with C is 100% consistent, except for a few Celtic & Gallic words.
         1. Celtic /kɛɫ.tɪk/ → C̊éltic
      6. The rule with G is broken basically all the time, especially in fundamental vocabulary and in many spelling codas like bag→bagged, rug→rugged, etc. — but these have double G.
         1. get, give, git, gild,&#x20;

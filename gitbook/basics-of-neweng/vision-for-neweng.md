# Vision for NewEng

We have to treat English as a global language, so its markings must support people learning pronunciation as per the common models.

Etymology is not only about studying ancient language. It also allows us to recognise word families within modern English, and even similar words in other languages. If all spellings are simplified to become completely phonetic, most of these word families will become difficult to notice, which would reduce people's ability to learn and recall vocabulary.

# Spelling conversion logic

## Primary Goals but written concisely

1. Simplify spellings.
   1. One letter has one sound, but one sound can be made by several letters. Diacritics are allowed; consonant respelling is preferred. No digraphs.
   2. No double letters (unless necessary).
   3. No vowels split apart.
   4. Phonetic consonant respelling (where reasonable).
   5. Phonetic vowel respelling (if diacritics are too messy).
2. Increase visual consistency & distinction.
   1. Preserve etymological spelling patterns.
   2. Retain visual distinctions between homophones.
   3. Increase visual distinction between homographs & homonyms.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Simplify spellings.

One letter has one sound (phoneme).     E.g.:

* t is always /t/
* þ is always /θ/

One sound can be made by many letters.     E.g.:

* /ʃ/ can be made by ʃ, š, ťiV, ʞ̌, ч̌, ç̌
* /k/ can be made by c, k, q, ʞ
* /ʤ/ can be made by j, ǧ, ď

Modifications are allowed using diacritics.

Multiple letters are allowed to produce the same phonemic values.

No double letters, unless necessary.

No vowel combinations split apart (like ⟨a⟩ in ⟨face⟩).

Phonetic respelling for standard pronunciation mutations.

Voiced ⟨s⟩ suffix after voiced codas, compare ducks /dʌks/ & dogs /dɔɡz/.

g as j /ʤ/ in ⟨ge/gi/gy⟩

Phonetic respelling for unreasonable or unresolvable vowel variations.

⟨ou⟩ is remarkably common and also remarkably nonsensical.&#x20;



1. Retain & maximize visual & aural distinctions.
   1. Preserve etymological spelling patterns.
   2. Retain visual distinctions between homophones.
      1. Not all homophones are homophones in every accent. Erasing distinctions is deleterious and culturally insensitive. Grammatic homophones tend to exist in most accents, whereas semantic homophones tend to have arisen as a result of [phonological mergers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Splits_and_mergers_in_English_phonology).
         1. Semantic: bow/bough
         2. Grammatic: passed/past
   3. Increase visual distinction between homographs and homonyms.
      1. Bow — /baw/ vs /bəw/ → baw vs bōw
      2. Row — /ɹaw/ vs /ɹəw/
      3.



## Simplification

The primary goals

### Double letter simplifications

* ck → k -- the k is to prevent e/i/y from changing the c into a /s/. Keep the k.

## Digraph simplifications

We replace all digraphs with single letters. This is the reason for adding new letters to the alphabet.

### Consonants

* ch → ч -- English digraph as /ʧ/
* ch → ч̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* ch → ʞ -- Greek-root digraph as /k\~x/
* ch → ʞ̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/ from Greek as /k/&#x20;
* gh → ȝ -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/
* gh → ȝ̌ -- digraph as /f\~ɸ/
* gh → ȝ̊ -- digraph as /ɡ/
* gn → ȝn -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/+/n/
* gn → ȝ̊n -- non-digraph as /ɡn/ showing relation to /ɣn/
* ny → и -- Spanish-root digraph as /ɲ/
* ñ → и -- Spanish monograph as /ɲ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋ -- English digraph as /ŋ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋg -- English digraph as /ŋɡ/ (deficient)&#x20;
* ng → nǧ -- English digraph as /nʤ/ (deficient) \[consider ⟨nj⟩]
* ph → φ -- Greek-root digraph as /f/
* sh → ʃ -- English digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* th → þ -- English digraph as /θ/&#x20;
* th → ð -- English digraph as /ð/&#x20;
* wh → ƕ -- English digraph as /w\~ʍ/

### Vowel digraphs (simple ones)

* ae → æ
* oe → œ
* oo → ꝏ&#x20;
* ou → ȣ -- (not as /aw/)



## Suffixes

* -ness -- retain double s, -ness marks a noun -- different from -n+es
* -less -- retain double s, -less marks some adjectives -- different from -l+es



## Vowel respellings

### Monophthong Vowels&#x20;

#### Monographs

* wa- and wha- as /wɔ/ → wo- and who- -- ⟨a⟩ never makes the /ɔ/ vowels unless preceded by a ⟨w⟩.

#### Digraphs

* ⟨ae⟩ as /ɪː\~eː/ → æ&#x20;
* ⟨oe⟩ as /ɪj\~yː/ → œ -- protects pronunciation&#x20;



### Diphthong Vowels

Monographs — Magic E

Monographs are singular letters which carry a diphthong value — two vowel sounds together.&#x20;

Magic E diphthongs are considered as monographs because, when the final E is removed to make way for a suffix, the Magic E vowel maintains its diphthong value.



* a as&#x20;

#### Monographs — no Magic E

* i in "kind" → ī = kīnd&#x20;
* o in "go" → ō = gō&#x20;
*



#### Digraphs

* ⟨ou⟩ as /aw/ → ⟨aŭ⟩ and ⟨aw⟩





### R-tail Vowels - rules retained

The Vowel+R rules are retained in NewEng.

#### Vowel+R

* -er → -r -- if the E is unpronounced or is unstressed /ɜː/\~/ə/&#x20;

#### Vowel+R+E

* -are → ăr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "mare", "square", "spare", "bare"&#x20;
* -ere → ĕr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "there", "where"
* -ire → īr for /ɑjə(ɹ)/ in "fire," "dire", "mire", "wire"
* -ore → or for /ɔ:(ɹ)/ in "more", "core", "lore"



### W-tail Vowels - rules removed

The _Vowel+W_ rules from Current English are NOT retained in NewEng.&#x20;

Vowels retain their base value, plus the /w/ closing position.&#x20;

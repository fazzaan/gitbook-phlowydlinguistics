# Spelling conversion logic

### Double letter simplifications

* ck → k -- the k is to prevent e/i/y from changing the c into a /s/. Keep the k.

## Digraph simplifications

We replace all digraphs with single letters. This is the reason for adding new letters to the alphabet.

### Consonants

* ch → ч -- English digraph as /ʧ/
* ch → ч̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* ch → ʞ -- Greek-root digraph as /k\~x/
* ch → ʞ̌ -- French digraph as /ʃ/ from Greek as /k/&#x20;
* gh → ȝ -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/
* gh → ȝ̌ -- digraph as /f\~ɸ/
* gh → ȝ̊ -- digraph as /ɡ/
* gn → ȝn -- digraph as /◌\~ɣ/+/n/
* gn → ȝ̊n -- non-digraph as /ɡn/ showing relation to /ɣn/
* ny → и -- Spanish-root digraph as /ɲ/
* ñ → и -- Spanish monograph as /ɲ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋ -- English digraph as /ŋ/&#x20;
* ng → ŋg -- English digraph as /ŋɡ/ (deficient)&#x20;
* ng → nǧ -- English digraph as /nʤ/ (deficient) \[consider ⟨nj⟩]
* ph → φ -- Greek-root digraph as /f/
* sh → ʃ -- English digraph as /ʃ/&#x20;
* th → þ -- English digraph as /θ/&#x20;
* th → ð -- English digraph as /ð/&#x20;
* wh → ƕ -- English digraph as /w\~ʍ/

### Vowel digraphs (simple ones)

* ae → æ
* oe → œ
* oo → ꝏ&#x20;
* ou → ȣ -- (not as /aw/)



## Suffixes

* \-ness -- retain double s, -ness marks a noun -- different from -n+es
* \-less -- retain double s, -less marks some adjectives -- different from -l+es



## Vowel respellings

### Monophthong Vowels&#x20;

#### Monographs

* wa- and wha- as /wɔ/ → wo- and who- -- ⟨a⟩ never makes the /ɔ/ vowels unless preceded by a ⟨w⟩.

#### Digraphs

* ⟨ae⟩ as /ɪː\~eː/ → æ&#x20;
* ⟨oe⟩ as /ɪj\~yː/ → œ -- protects pronunciation&#x20;



### Diphthong Vowels

Monographs — Magic E

Monographs are singular letters which carry a diphthong value — two vowel sounds together.&#x20;

Magic E diphthongs are considered as monographs because, when the final E is removed to make way for a suffix, the Magic E vowel maintains its diphthong value.



* a as&#x20;

#### Monographs — no Magic E

* i in "kind" → ī = kīnd&#x20;
* o in "go" → ō = gō&#x20;
*



#### Digraphs

* ⟨ou⟩ as /aw/ → ⟨aŭ⟩ and ⟨aw⟩





### R-tail Vowels - rules retained

The Vowel+R rules are retained in NewEng.

#### Vowel+R

* \-er → -r -- if the E is unpronounced or is unstressed /ɜː/\~/ə/&#x20;

#### Vowel+R+E

* \-are → ăr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "mare", "square", "spare", "bare"&#x20;
* \-ere → ĕr for /ɛː(ɹ)/ in "there", "where"
* \-ire → īr for /ɑjə(ɹ)/ in "fire," "dire", "mire", "wire"
* \-ore → or for /ɔ:(ɹ)/ in "more", "core", "lore"



### W-tail Vowels - rules removed

The _Vowel+W_ rules from Current English are NOT retained in NewEng.&#x20;

Vowels retain their base value, plus the /w/ closing position.&#x20;

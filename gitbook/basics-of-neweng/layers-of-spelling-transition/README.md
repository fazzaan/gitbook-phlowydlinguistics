# Layers of spelling transition

Each of these transitionary layers may happen separately or in combination. Some layers would help ease transition over a few years or maybe even a couple of generations; other layers would be better to occur simultaneously.

1. Mark stress.
   1. This should have been done centuries ago.
   2. **changes → chánges**
2. Letter conversion.
   1. Changing digraphs for new monographs (consonants and vowels).
   2. Retaining spelling system (Magic E, duplicated letters, suffixes etc).
   3. Update consonant copes and deficiencies (finger → fiŋger).
   4. **chánges → чánges**
3. Consonant diacritics.
   1. Keeps the spelling as similar as possible.
   2. Update consonant copes (e.g. guild → g̊ild or g̊u̇ld).
   3. **чánges → чánǧes̈**
4. Phonetic consonants.&#x20;
   1. Replace consonants with more-phonetic consonants, but only the most common ones, so that people can easily learn the common letter mutations.
   2. **чánǧes̈ → чánjez**
5. Rebuild vowel system.
   1. Replace Magic E spellings with macron diacritic. Retain additional vowels if they don't break the Magic E diphthong, for visual differentiation.&#x20;
   2. Mark vowel mutations and reductions with appropriate diacritics, systematic if possible.
   3. Vowel reformation: Replace nonsense vowels with accurate vowels, especially diphthongs (like ou for /aw/) and digraphs (like au for /oː/).
   4. Update consonant copes, e.g. duplicate letters (dinner → díner).
   5. **чánjez → чā́njėz**

## Phases of Transition

### Phase 1

Phase 1 combines Layers 1 & 2: Mark stress, and Letter conversion.&#x20;

Phase 1 transition should be easily readable by anyone who spends a few hours familiarising themselves with the substitutions. The new letters are easily writable by just paying attention to the pronunciation of the current digraphs and mentally double-checking for the pronunciation patterns of any obviously-related words.

#### Layer 1: Mark stress

Marking stress is simple and easy, as this is a feature in a lot of languages: á.

In handwriting, this is extremely simple. The angle must be enforced because a future phase (Layer 5) will introduce 3 other diacritic marks which have the potential to look similar: á à ā ȧ.

In typing, a key can be repurposed for the stress diacritic, or&#x20;

Stress only needs to be marked on words with multiple syllables.&#x20;

Layer 5 introduces diacritics for vowels. If a vowel has a diacritic, it is assumed to take stress. If that vowel is the stressed syllable, no stress diacritic is required. If the stressed syllable is elsewhere, the correct vowel requires a stress diacritic.

#### Layer 2: Letter conversion

In the letter conversion transition layer, all standard digraphs are replaced with monographs, primarily new letters.&#x20;

_**Limitations**_

To ease transition within the current generation of people and technology, all new letters must exist within Unicode and have an upper and a lower case glyph available. Preferably the cases are linked in their Unicode definitions, but sometimes that is not possible (Ʞ and ʞ are appear to not be connected correctly in the Unicode definition, and most apps also have not made the connection).

_**Letters**_

The current English digraphs are:&#x20;

H-series: ch gh ph sh th th wh

Other: ck

Vowels: ae a\_e ai au aw ay / ea ee e\_e ei ew ey / ie i\_e / oa oe o\_e oi oo ou ow oy / ue u\_e ui uy

_Qu is not a digraph. The q represents a /k/ (a pharyngeal allophone) before a /w/, a non-syllabic allophone of u._&#x20;

Consonant digraphs can be replaced easily; vowel digraphs are dramatically messier.

* ch → ч   —   /ʧ/ in English and /ʃ/ in French words
* ch → ʞ   —   /k/ in Greek words and /ʃ/ in Greek words via French
* gh → ȝ   —   /ɣ\~ɸ\~f\~(x)/ and silence (modern phonology)
* ph → φ  —   /f/ in Greek words
* sh → ʃ    —   /ʃ/ in English words
* th → þ   —   /θ/ in English and Greek words
* th → ð   —   /ð/ in English and Greek words
* wh → ƕ —   /ʰw\~ʍ/ in English words (probably P/Q Celt division)

The only vowels being replaced at this stage are the four true digraphs:

* ae → æ   —   /e/ in Latin & Greek words, maybe also Old English
* oe → œ   —   /y/ in Latin & Greek words
* oo → ꝏ  —   /uw/ and /ɵ\~ʊ/ in English words
* ou → ȣ    —   /uw/ and /ɵ\~ʊ/ in English etc words

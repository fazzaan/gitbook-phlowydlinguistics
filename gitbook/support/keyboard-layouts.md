# Keyboard layouts

### Physical keyboards

1. **Use AltGr to access 3rd level** on regular QWERTY layout.&#x20;
   1. Works with normal keyboards.
   2. Clunky to use.
   3. Retains number row.
2. **Use number row** for 11 new letters (including \` key).
   1. Works with normal keyboards.
   2. Displaces number row — requires NumPad for numbers.
   3. Easier to use than AltGr version, but takes time to learn the new letters' positions.
   4. Still requires AltGr for æ, œ, и, ç and all diacritics (on u, i, o, b, m, -, ;, ', ]).
   5. Requires AltGr to access symbols from standard number row. (Can use Shift+AltGr to access numbers).
   6. Can use AltGr to access some diacritiqued letters: ž ẍ ç s̈ g̊ g̃ ǧ ť.
   7. Hwair ƕ and Echo ʞ are available on w and k, respectively.
   8. F# keys are not used much these days so could feasibly be used as the number row instead.
3. **Physical keyboard with another row**.
   1. Requires a new physical keyboard device.
   2. Visually clear, no need to memorize where each letter is hiding.
   3. Minor skill adaptation required, number+symbol row has moved upwards.

# English language tree

At this time this is really just guesswork. Educated, but I didn't study this carefully, and I didn't go to research it all before making it.

Take it with a teaspoon of salt.

Also, I'll research it properly soon and create a more accurate version.

I have made the effort to study some of each language class related to modern English. Each of these languages features a lot of cognates, **enriching the brain's automatic etymological tree of knowledge**.

* **Spanish**, basic, I can hold a simple conversation
* **Greek**, basic, I can read it, the grammar is hard, there are many cognates
* **German**, very basic, just school level
* **Hindi**, extremely basic, I can read most letters, remember some words, understand basic grammar

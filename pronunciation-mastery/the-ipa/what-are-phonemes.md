## THE ALPHABET LETTERS ARE NOT PHONEMES

First of all, we must realise that **Letters** of the Alphabet **are NOT phonemes**.

Letters in _your_ alphabet _**might**_ be phonemic, or even phonetic, **but this is rare.**

**Even if your school, country, culture, government told you that your alphabet is phonetic, perfect, flawless!,&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**usually this is**</mark><mark style="color:red;">**&#x20;**</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**not**</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**&#x20;**</mark><mark style="color:red;">**true**</mark>. Sorry. It is best that you know the truth, otherwise you can't learn properly.



I have studied a range of languages, each with different alphabets and scripts, and I have yet to see a script that is perfectly self-consistent.

The closest I've seen are Vietnamese and Devanagari.

Also, no, your language does _**not**_ include every sound of English. And it is unlikely that it contains every sound of any other language.&#x20;

The most likely contender for being included entirely inside another language is Spanish, because it has only 21-23 phonemes.

There are so many variations on how to pronounce each phoneme on the IPA table that it is extremely unlikely that your native language includes identical pronunciations as those of English.&#x20;

This is important to consider because if you look at IPA tables for different languages, they typically show simplified IPA symbols, so even if it looks like all phonemes of one language are within another language, they still probably **aren't**.

(For example, English "p" is listed as /p/, but it is actually /pʰ/ in most positions. Your language probably lists /p/ as well, but it is likely to be /p/ and not /pʰ/.)

## Phones

We can divide pronunciation into tiny units called _phones_. No, not the telephone type.

_Phone_ simply means _sound_.

And this is also related to the word _phthongos_ from Ancient Greek, which means _sound_ too.



## Phonemes

However, if we consider _every single tiniest sound unit_ as a _separate_ sound, speech becomes unreasonably complicated.

Instead, we can group these phones into sets, which are called _phonemes_.

The concept of a phoneme is a group of sounds which all serve the same function, but sound different in different positions. A **p** at the beginning of a word sounds different to a **p** in the middle of a word and at the end of word. It also sounds different if there is an unvoiced friction sound before it inside the same word, like **sp**.

All of these variations are simply too many for the normal person to learn and practise — however, these sounds emerge automatically if you just focus on a couple of key instructions for each sound. These unique _phones_ within each _phoneme_ are known as _**allophones**_.

This is how we create the concept of a phoneme.

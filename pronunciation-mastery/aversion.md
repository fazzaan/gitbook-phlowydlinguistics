Swear words and other undesirable words

By learning these words, and learning which words they typically mispronounce _as_ such words, their desire to _not_ say them will guide them towards a) correctly pronouncing the words and b) fixing their overall pronunciation model, by way of them forcing themselves to develop the skill of pronouncing the sounds correctly.

It's honestly a surprise that this even needs to be explained, but here we are.

_Tonal_ examples in Vietnamese (because apparently some people can't grasp the importance of this)

|           |          |          |           |

Needless to say, mis-intonating these words

## Swear words

_**and other undesirable words**_

By learning these words, and learning which words they typically mispronounce _as_ such words, students' desire to _not_ say them will guide them towards **a)** correctly pronouncing the words and **b)** fixing their overall pronunciation model, by way of them forcing themselves to develop the skill of pronouncing the sounds correctly.

Needless to say, mis-intonating these words is problematic in normal conversation, especially if you are speaking your non-native language, as you will likely have several other problems, such as personal accent, mispronunciations, lack of phonemes, grammatical mistakes, missing words, and more!

_Language is a large skill, encompassing a multitude of smaller skills which all work together in concert._

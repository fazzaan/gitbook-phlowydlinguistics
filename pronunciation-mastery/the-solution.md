# The Solution

So, what's the solution to all this?

Well, after a while, reading about all these mistakes and the confusions that are produced, you will start to realise that, instead of trying to fix all these mistakes with more and more patches, plasters and patterns, it's actually better to just go to the root: learn the pronunciation model _properly_ and stop following people who can't actually pronounce correctly, because clearly they don't have the right methods and techniques.



Study the mouth.&#x20;

The organs of articulation.

The positions inside the mouth.

The methods of producing sound.

The combinations of positions and methods.

The symbols that represent those positions and methods.



Understand how your _native_ language is pronounced.

Yes, you can pronounce it already, but it is natural, it is your reflex.

Go deeper into learning how it is defined and how it manifests.

What are the smallest units of sound in your language?

What is the relationship of these sounds to each other?

What assumptions are made for each sound?

What allophones exist of each sound?

How do the sounds join together?&#x20;

How do they affect each other?

What is the model of a syllable?

How do words join together?



Back to the IPA...

Practise every single position and method.

Become a master of your own mouth. (Nobody else can control your mouth!)

Feel the positions in your mouth as you are making the sounds.

Experiment with how you create each sound. What variations can you make?



Now understand the pronunciation system of the new language.

What sounds (phonemes) does it contain?

How are they similar to your language?

How are they different from your language?

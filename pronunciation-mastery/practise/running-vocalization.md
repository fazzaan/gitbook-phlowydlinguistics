# Running Vocalization

"Connected speech" goes deeper than you realise.&#x20;

Actually, the voice (i.e. vocal cords) _never_ stop vibrating, except for in four situations:

1. an unvoiced _**phoneme**_ (not letter)
2. breathing
3. thinking
4. listening

As you can see, the only unvoiced moments that are correct within the process of pronouncing words are those moments in which an unvoiced phoneme is to be pronounced. At all other times through the pronunciation of your speech, you should maintain vibration of your vocal cords.

You can test this in yourself by placing your fingers on the centre of your throat to feel the vibrations.

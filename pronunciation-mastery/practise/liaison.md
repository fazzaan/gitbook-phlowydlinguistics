# "Liaison"

_Practising “liaison” for every word connection_

## The Myth of Liaison

_Main article:_ [the-myth-of-liaison.md](../myths-and-facts/the-myth-of-liaison.md "mention")_._

First of all, “liaison” doesn’t exist in English.&#x20;

_Definition of "Liaison":_

> _**Phonetics**_
>
> _(in French and other languages)_ the sounding of a consonant that is _**normally silent**_ at the end of a word, _because the next word begins with a vowel_.

You can see that this does not exist in English, because the final sounds of words are always pronounced. Even if the final T is “dropped”, it is actually dropped downwards into the glottis, producing the glottal stop /ʔ/.&#x20;

If the final T were completely unpronounced — removed — a word would sound wrong: _cat_ would become _cahh_, _but_ would become _buhh_, _fit_ would become _fihh_. This is not the case.

* Practise every single word connection that you can think of.&#x20;
* Even practise ones which you don't know if they exist!&#x20;
* Learn to pronounce each phoneme alone, [devoid of](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] any vowel sound before or after it.

Read through this list of word connections to practise the ways of connecting various pairs & sets of phonemes.
